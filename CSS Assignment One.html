 <p style="color:red"><b><i> I have learnt a lot so far ranging from CSS attributes, properties, HTML tags and elements, CSS inheritance, CSS hierarchy, CSS triplicate styling and that id selector carries the most weight. </i></b></p>
  <p style="color:red"><b><i> CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.</i></b></p>

  <h2>Third section</h2>
  <p style="color:blue"><b><i>In CSS, a margin is the space around an element’s border, while padding is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content. Padding is the inner space between the content and the border of your box. Margin is the outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box. Border is the perimeter of the box; they can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured above.</i></b></p>
